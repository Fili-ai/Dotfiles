### Search:
Useful references:
- [Simpler guide](https://thevaluable.dev/vim-search-find-replace/)


#### Method 1:
"/" or "?" <keyword>: search in the file and press enter to highlight occurrences.
Use n to go to the next match and N to go to the previous match.

#### Method 2:
Highlight the word you want to search and press * to search for the word. As before, use n and N to go to the next and previous match.

### Search and replace:
by default, i have [nvim-spectre](https://github.com/nvim-pack/nvim-spectre).
<leader>sr: search and replace in the file, after inserting the word you want to replace, come back to normal mode and use <leader> + R to replace all the occurrences in the file.
